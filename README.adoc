## React Versions Support

`react-popover` `>= 0.5.0` supports React 16 while `react-popover` `< 0.5.0` works with React `15.x.x` and likely lower. There is no plan to support older versions of this library with back-ported patches and PRs for that purpose are not welcome since it increases maintenance for the authors.

## Installation

```
yarn add react-popover
```

## Examples

Here is a minimal example of react-popover that the popover is displayed by clicking the button.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Popover from "react-popover";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOpen: false };
  }

  togglePopover = () => {
    this.setState({ isOpen: !this.state.isOpen });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Popover
          isOpen={this.state.isOpen}
          body={<div>Popover Content</div>}
          place="below"
          onOuterAction={this.togglePopover}
        >
          <button onClick={this.togglePopover}>Toggle Popover</button>
        </Popover>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

react-popover does not come with any styles by default. You can modify the design of react-popover by adding styles to `.Popover-body` and `.Popover-tipShape`.

```css
.Popover-body {
  display: inline-flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 2rem 4rem;
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 27%);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 0.3rem;
}

.Popover-tipShape {
  fill: hsl(0, 0%, 27%);
}
```

## API

### `export default` `Popover(props, target)`

#### `props :: {...}`

---

##### `body :: Node | Array Node`
The `popover` content.

---

##### `isOpen :: Boolean`
Determines Whether or not the popover is rendered.

---

##### `preferPlace :: Enum String | Null`
Sets a ***preference*** of where to position the Popover. Only useful to specify placement in case of multiple available fits. Defaults to `null`. Valid values are:

`above | right | below | left` :: Prefer an explicit side.
`row | column` :: Prefer an orientation.
`start | end` :: Prefer an order.
`null` :: No preference, automatic resolution. This is the default.

---

##### `place :: String | Null`
Like `preferPlace` except that the given place is a ***requirement***. The resolver becomes scoped or disabled. It is scoped if the `place` is an `orientation` or `order` but disabled if it is a `side`. For example `place: "row"` scopes the resolver to `above` or `below` placement but `place: "above"` removes any need for the resolver.

---

##### `onOuterAction :: (Event) -> Void`
A callback function executed every time the user does an action (`mousedown` or `touchstart`) outside the DOM tree of both `Popover` and `Target`. A canonical use-case is to automatically close the Popover on any external user action.

---

##### `refreshIntervalMs :: Number | Falsey`
The polling speed (AKA time between each poll) in milliseconds for checking if a layout refresh is required. This polling is required because it is the only robust way to track the position of a target in the DOM. Defaults to `200`. Set to a falsey value to disable.

---

#### `enterExitTransitionDurationMs :: Number | Falsey`
The amount of time in milliseconds that it takes to complete the enter and exit animation. Defaults to '500'.

---

#### `tipSize :: Number`
Defines the size of the tip pointer.  Use .01 to disable tip.  Defaults to '7'.

---

##### Standard

* Properties like `className` and `style`.


---

#### `target :: ReactElement`

- The React Element that this popover will orient itself around. `target` `rendering tree` is unaffected. `Popover` _will_ become its `owner`.

---

#### `appendTarget :: DOMElement`

- The DOM element which the https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html[portal] will mount into. In effect the popover will become an appended child of this DOM element. Defaults to 'document.body'.
